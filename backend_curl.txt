Face Swap API Curl Commands
1. Detect Faces in Base Image

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/detect-faces/" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "base_image_url": "https://example.com/base-image.jpg",
    "swap_faces_urls": [],
    "target_face_index": null
  }'


Returns a base64 encoded preview image with numbered faces and face detection information.
2. Standard Face Swap (Single or Multiple Faces)

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/swap-faces/" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "base_image_url": "https://example.com/base-image.jpg",
    "swap_faces_urls": [
      "https://example.com/face1.jpg",
      "https://example.com/face2.jpg"
    ],
    "target_face_index": null
  }'

Swaps faces in the base image with the provided face images. If target_face_index is null, swaps all faces.
3. Enhanced Face Swap (Multiple Source Images for Better Quality)

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/enhanced-swap-faces/" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "base_image_url": "https://example.com/base-image.jpg",
    "swap_faces_urls": [
      "https://example.com/face1.jpg",
      "https://example.com/face2.jpg",
      "https://example.com/face3.jpg"
    ],
    "target_face_index": 0
  }'

Performs an enhanced face swap by combining features from multiple source images for better quality.
The system will average facial features from all source images to create a more robust face representation.
4. Get Result Image

curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/result/RESULT_FILENAME" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  --output result.jpg

Downloads the processed image. Replace RESULT_FILENAME with the filename from the swap response.
Notes
Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual API key
Replace example URLs with actual image URLs
Face indices are 0-based (first face is index 0)
Set target_face_index to null to swap all faces
Supported formats: jpg, jpeg, png
All URLs must be valid HTTP/HTTPS URLs
For enhanced face swap, provide multiple source images of the same person for best results
The enhanced face swap combines features from all source images to improve quality
Example Workflow
1. Use detect-faces endpoint to see available faces in the base image
2. Choose between standard swap or enhanced swap based on your needs:
   - Standard swap: Good for quick swaps with single source images
   - Enhanced swap: Better quality when you have multiple source images of the same person
3. Download result using result endpoint
